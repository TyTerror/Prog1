Assumptions
----------------------------------------
1.) A line is 80 characters long
    a.)I repeated 0-9 at the top to show it
    b)I assumed an inch was 6 characters 12pt font
2.)I don't think font size matters because during testing the size was just defaulting
3.)My program has a few problems
    a.)It starts to get wonky when the margin is VERY thin
    b.)Sometimes a word might go slightly over the margin if it is the beginning of a new sentence and has two spaces.
