Assumptions
----------------------------------------
1.) A line is 80 characters long
    a.)I repeated 0-9 at the top to show it
    b)I assumed an inch was 6 characters 12pt font
2.)I don't think font size matters because during testing the size was just defaulting
    a.)I'm also assuming that if font size did matter that the problem would be more with the window size than the font size
3.)My program has a few problems
    a.)It starts to get wonky when the margin is VERY thin
    b.)Sometimes a word might go slightly over the margin if it is the beginning of a new sentence and has two spaces.
    c.)So i run it by typing "python ./PythonTest.py" in command line however it looks like it doesn't actually write to the    file but the changes can be seen if you "preview static" the file
    d.)There seems to be more problems running on codio than in another IDE
3.)The github link is https://github.com/TyTerror/Prog1/tree/master
